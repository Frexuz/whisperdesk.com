description: Perform a Rails-focused security review of the pending changes on the current branch (server‑rendered app)
---

You are a senior Rails application security engineer reviewing ONLY the newly introduced or modified code in this branch. Ignore pre‑existing issues unless the diff worsens them.

GIT STATUS
```
!`git status`
```

FILES MODIFIED
```
!`git diff --name-only origin/HEAD...`
```

COMMITS
```
!`git log --no-decorate origin/HEAD...`
```

DIFF CONTENT (Full patch under review)
```
!`git diff --merge-base origin/HEAD`
```

OBJECTIVE
Identify HIGH‑CONFIDENCE, exploitable security vulnerabilities introduced by this change set in a typical server‑rendered Rails stack (ERB + ActiveRecord + standard middleware). Output only actionable security findings (High / clear Medium). Skip style, performance, theoretical or legacy concerns.

STATIC ANALYSIS EXECUTION (Run these now; incorporate only HIGH/clear MEDIUM security-impacting results that are in changed code):

Run Brakeman (quiet, full checks, JSON + text for clarity):
```
!`bundle exec brakeman -q -A -f tabs`
```
If needed for structured parsing, also:
```
!`bundle exec brakeman -q -A -f json`
```
Interpretation Guidance:
- Report only warnings that map to modified files/lines in the diff and are clearly exploitable.
- Ignore generic "Confidence: Weak" or library version warnings.

Run RuboCop (including Security cops if enabled):
```
!`bundle exec rubocop --force-exclusion`
```
If a large codebase, optionally narrow to changed files:
```
!`git diff --name-only --diff-filter=AM origin/HEAD... | grep -E '\\.rb$' | xargs bundle exec rubocop --force-exclusion --parallel`
```
RuboCop Guidance:
- Only elevate cops with direct security impact (e.g., Security/*, Rails/OutputSafety) that appear in modified lines.
- Ignore style/layout offenses.

Optional (not required here): `bundle exec bundler-audit check --update` – gem CVEs are handled elsewhere; do not include in findings.

KEY RAILS SECURITY AREAS TO EXAMINE (apply ONLY where touched by the diff):

Input & Query Safety
- ActiveRecord query construction: raw SQL via `find_by_sql`, `pluck(Arel.sql(...))`, string interpolation in `where`, `order`, `select`, `joins`. Flag untrusted interpolation lacking parameterization.
- Unsafe dynamic column / table names derived from params without whitelisting.
- Arel.sql usage without clear sanitization comment.

Mass Assignment & Strong Parameters
- Controllers: `params.require(...).permit(...)` presence. Flag use of `params[:model]` directly or `Model.new(params[:model])` without strong params.
- Usage of `update(params[:...])` vs `update(permitted_params)`.

Authentication / Authorization
- New controller actions lacking authentication guard (e.g. `before_action :authenticate_user!`).
- Authorization logic (Pundit/CanCan/custom) bypass: direct record access without policy / ability check where other similar actions enforce one.
- Session fixation or manual cookie tampering logic; custom session stores modifications.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- ERB templates adding raw (`raw`, `html_safe`, `sanitize(..., tags: ALL)`) around user input.
- JSON / JS ERB interpolation without `j` or escaping.
- Unsafe helper methods rendering user HTML without sanitization.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Disabling `protect_from_forgery` or skipping CSRF on state‑changing endpoints without a strong justification (webhook, API with alternate auth).

Insecure Redirects / Open Redirect
- `redirect_to params[:next]` (or similar) without host / path validation (`allow_other_host: false` or whitelist check).

File & Path Handling
- Use of `File.open`, `send_file`, `Rails.root.join` with user input enabling traversal; missing extension/content-type validation for uploads.

Command / Constant / Code Injection
- `system`, backticks, `%x{}`, `Open3.capture*` with interpolated untrusted input.
- Dynamic constantization (`constantize`, `safe_constantize`, `camelize`) from user params without whitelist.
- `eval`, `instance_eval`, `class_eval`, `send`/`public_send` with user-controlled method names.

Serialization / Deserialization
- YAML.load / Psych.load (vs safe_load) on untrusted input.
- Marshal.load of user data.

SSRF & External HTTP
- `Net::HTTP`, `URI.open`, `Faraday.get` using unvalidated user-supplied URLs (host / scheme control). (Path-only changes are not SSRF.)

Crypto & Secrets
- Hardcoded secrets, API keys, signing secrets in code (should leverage credentials / ENV). (Existing ones unchanged are out-of-scope.)
- Weak or custom password hashing (should be bcrypt / has_secure_password / devise). New custom crypto logic flagged.

Data Exposure & Privacy
- Rendering of sensitive attributes (password_digest, tokens) in views, JSON, logs introduced by diff.
- New debug endpoints leaking environment or stack traces.

Caching / Headers / CS Policy
- New public caches of personalized data.
- Relaxing of `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security` initializers.

Background Jobs / Async
- Jobs enqueuing user-provided class names / method names / serialized arguments unsafely.

Configuration & Initializers
- Disabling security middleware, adjusting cookie settings (`secure`, `httponly`, `same_site`) insecurely.

WHAT NOT TO REPORT (Noise Filter)
- Pure style or formatting (handled by RuboCop).
- Legacy issues pre-existing unchanged.
- Gem version CVEs (handled elsewhere).
- DOS / performance / rate limiting concerns.
- Theoretical race conditions without concrete exploitation.
- Test-only code or factories.

METHODOLOGY
1. Context: Skim diff to map modified controllers, models, views, helpers, jobs, initializers.
2. Trace data: For each user entry point (params, headers, cookies, file uploads), follow flow to sinks (DB queries, file system, rendering, shell, external HTTP).
3. Compare to existing patterns: Are similar actions using strong params, policies, escaping? Highlight deviations.
4. Assess exploitability: Only list issues with a plausible, concrete attack path an external or authenticated adversary could execute.

OUTPUT FORMAT (Markdown)
Each finding:
### <Category>: `path/to/file.rb:LINE`
* Severity: High|Medium
* Confidence: (0.8–1.0 for reported issues)
* Description: Concise statement of the vulnerable pattern
* Exploit Scenario: Short realistic example (attacker goal & vector)
* Recommendation: Precise Rails‑idiomatic fix (e.g. "Use parameter binding: where(id: params[:id])", "Add strong params permit list", "Replace html_safe with safe_join/escape")

Severity Guidelines
- HIGH: Auth/authorization bypass, injection leading to data exfiltration or RCE, XSS enabling session/token theft, mass assignment of sensitive fields, CSRF disablement on sensitive actions, SSRF with host control, arbitrary file read/write.
- MEDIUM: Open redirect, reflected XSS needing user click, unsafe dynamic constantization with partial constraints, potential SQL injection requiring crafted parameter, sensitive data exposure without full account compromise.

Confidence (report only ≥0.8)
- 0.9–1.0: Clear vulnerable code path with trivial exploit.
- 0.8–0.89: Well-known pattern; minimal assumptions.
<0.8 not reported.

EXCLUSIONS (DO NOT REPORT)
Matches the "WHAT NOT TO REPORT" plus: secrets already in encrypted credentials; theoretical timing attacks; subtle browser side-channels; prototype pollution; tabnabbing; low-risk open redirects limited to same host; minor CSP relaxations with no active exploit.

FALSE POSITIVE FILTER (Apply before listing)
Is the input truly user-controlled? Is there a direct path to the sink? Does Rails auto-escaping or parameterization already mitigate it? If any mitigation clearly applies, do not report.

FINAL TASK
Provide ONLY the findings (or state "No High or Medium severity vulnerabilities identified in changed code."). Do not include tool outputs or unrelated commentary.
