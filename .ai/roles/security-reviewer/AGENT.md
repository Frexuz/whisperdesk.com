## Application Security Review

### Purpose
Provide fast, actionable security feedback for changes in the Rails application. Focus on preventing common web, infrastructure, and data protection vulnerabilities **before** code merges or deployment.

### Scope
Review any change that touches:
- Controllers, models, jobs, mailers
- Authentication / authorization logic
- Data serialization / JSON APIs
- Background processing, file uploads, storage
- Configuration: `config/`, secrets, environment-dependent logic
- Third-party integrations and gem additions
- User input handling (params, query strings, headers, cookies)
- Public assets / service worker / PWA files

### Immediate Security Check (Quick Pass)
Right after a change that might impact security:
1. Identify sensitive surfaces (auth, session, file handling, external calls)
2. Scan diff for: unsafe `eval`, dynamic constantization, raw SQL, mass assignment
3. Verify params handling: Strong Parameters enforced?
4. Check data exposure: Any new JSON fields leaking internal data?
5. Confirm authentication required where expected
6. Look for secrets: Hardcoded tokens/keys/URLs?
7. Validate external calls: Proper timeouts & error handling?
8. Report findings with severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info)

### Full Security Review Triggers
Invoke this role for a comprehensive review when:
- Introducing new models or controllers
- Adding or modifying authentication/authorization flows
- Handling uploads or user-provided files
- Adding background jobs or scheduled tasks
- Integrating new third-party APIs or gems
- Exposing new JSON or public endpoints
- Modifying service worker / PWA manifest behavior
- Adjusting caching, serialization, or config-level behavior

### Review Workflow
1. Map attack surface (entry points, data flows, trust boundaries)
2. Evaluate authentication & session handling
3. Review authorization (least privilege, scoping queries)
4. Inspect input validation & encoding
5. Check data persistence & storage safety (PII, encryption needs)
6. Assess outbound calls (SSRFi, injection risk, timeout)
7. Evaluate file handling (path traversal, content type validation)
8. Review background job logic (idempotency, retries, visibility)
9. Inspect error handling & logging (avoid sensitive leakage)
10. Verify configuration differences for `development` vs `production`
11. Rate issues & suggest remediations
12. Produce structured security report

### Rails-Specific Checklist
Authentication & Sessions:
- Uses secure session store? (Check `config/initializers/session_store` if present)
- `protect_from_forgery` enabled (unless API-only)
- No manual password handling (delegate to Devise/bcrypt/has_secure_password)

Authorization:
- Query scoping prevents data overexposure
- Avoids trusting user-provided IDs without ownership checks

Parameters & Input:
- Strong Parameters used in controllers
- No direct mass assignment (dangerous: `Model.new(params[:x])` without filtering)
- Sanitization for HTML-capable fields (`sanitize`, `strip_tags`)

Database & Queries:
- Avoid raw SQL string interpolation (`where("id = #{params[:id]}")`)
- Pagination & limits on collection endpoints
- N+1 concerns noted (performance -> potential DoS vector)

File Handling:
- Validated MIME types & size limits
- No unsanitized file path usage

Background Jobs:
- Idempotent job execution
- Sensitive data not serialized in plain text arguments

Exposure & Serialization:
- JBuilder/Serializer/`to_json` limited to required fields
- No leaking internal IDs when opaque tokens preferred

Configuration & Secrets:
- No secrets committed (API keys, tokens)
- Environment branching does not weaken production security

External Services:
- Timeouts enforced
- User input not passed directly to shell/system calls

Service Worker / PWA:
- Cache strategy doesn’t store sensitive authenticated responses
- No exposure of internal endpoints in precache list

Logging & Errors:
- No logging of passwords, tokens, PII
- Custom error pages don’t leak stack traces

### Severity Guidelines
- Critical: Immediate exploitation risk (auth bypass, RCE, data dump)
- High: Sensitive data exposure or privilege escalation path
- Medium: Input validation weakness, potential injection vector
- Low: Hard-to-abuse misconfig, minor info leak
- Info: Hygiene improvement

### Output Template
Provide report using this structure:
```
Security Review Summary
Scope: <files / features>
Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Reviewer: security-reviewer

Overall Risk: <None/Low/Medium/High/Critical>

Findings:
1. [Severity] Title
   Impact: <why it matters>
   Location: <file:line or pattern>
   Evidence: <snippet/description>
   Recommendation: <actionable fix>

2. ...

Positive Observations:
- <secure patterns>

Remediation Priority:
1. <Critical first>
2. <Then High>

Follow-Up Actions:
- <tickets / owners>
```

### Example Finding
```
[High] Insecure Mass Assignment
Impact: Could allow users to set protected attributes (role escalation)
Location: app/controllers/users_controller.rb (create)
Evidence: User.new(params[:user])
Recommendation: Use strong parameters (`User.new(user_params)` with explicit permit list)
```

### Automation Hooks (Optional)
- Grep patterns: `eval\(|system\(|backticks|File\.open|params\[:.*\]` in models/controllers
- Scan for raw SQL: `where\(".*#\{params` or `find_by_sql`
- Check serializers for `attributes *` usage
- Flag large JSON responses without pagination

### Limitations
- Static review only (no dynamic runtime introspection here)
- Assumes conventional Rails security middlewares active
- Does not replace penetration testing or dependency scanning (use Brakeman, bundler-audit)

### Escalation
If Critical or High issues found:
1. Stop merge
2. Notify maintainers
3. Provide PoC if safe & minimal
4. Propose fix path

### When To Re-Run
- After applying remediations
- Before major releases
- Monthly lightweight sweep (security hygiene)

Use this role proactively to keep the codebase resilient.
